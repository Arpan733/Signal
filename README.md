# Green Road - Flutter & Firebase Application

## About the Project:

Green Road is a mobile app built with Flutter and Firebase that provides real-time information about traffic signals. The app fetches the user's location to display the nearest signal, along with its current color and a countdown timer showing how much time is left before it changes.

## Key Features:

- **Real-time Location**: Identifies the nearest signal based on the user's location.
- **Signal Information**: Displays the signal's current color and remaining time.
- **Complex Algorithm**: A sophisticated algorithm powers the signal prediction and timer functionality, making it a highly complex solution.

## Technologies Used:

- **Flutter**: Frontend UI development.
- **Firebase**: Backend storage and real-time syncing.
- **Geolocation**: For real-time location tracking.

This project highlights my ability to integrate complex algorithms and real-time data in a user-friendly app.
